        <h2 id="content">RAGE is a research project led by Dr. Kirstyn Brunker from the University of Glasgow, in collaboration with partners across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The project aims to be a valuable resource for rabies virus genomic surveillance and other One Health-informed genomics research. </h2>

                <h3>Rabies</h3>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/rabiddog.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>Rabies is a fatal zoonotic pathogen that can infect all mammals. Despite a vaccine that is 100% effective, rabies still kills 59,000 people every year, primarily via bites from infected rabid dogs. </p>

                <p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/carSeq.jpg %}" alt="" /></span> The Next-generation sequencing technologies, particularly "4th generation" like Nanopore, have transformative potential in the global scientific community, particularly in the Global South. RAGE aims to improve access to cutting-edge, accessible sequencing technologies that can be used in low-resource settings.</p>

                <h3>Genomic Epidemiology</h3>
                <p>Pathogen sequence data is a powerful form of intelligence that can provide key and unique insights into pathogen spread. Genetic sequencing of pathogens has revolutionized the surveillance of infectious diseases, empowering scientists and health officials to anticipate and respond effectively to outbreaks. </p>
